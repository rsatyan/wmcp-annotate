## Problem Section

### Headline
**AI Agents Can't Use Your Website. Yet.**

Google and Microsoft just shipped WebMCP in Chrome 146. It's a new W3C standard that lets websites declare structured tools for AI agents.

**The catch?** 99% of websites don't have the annotations.

Without WebMCP, AI agents resort to:
- ❌ Fragile DOM scraping
- ❌ Expensive screenshot analysis (2000+ tokens per page)
- ❌ Broken automations when UI changes

---

## Solution Section

### Headline
**From Zero to AI-Ready in One Command**

```bash
npx wmcp-annotate generate https://your-site.com
```

wmcp-annotate:
1. **Scans** your website for forms, buttons, and APIs
2. **Suggests** tool definitions using AI
3. **Generates** ready-to-use JavaScript code
4. **Validates** your implementation
